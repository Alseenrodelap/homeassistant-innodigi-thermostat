# Release v1.17.2 - Heartbeat Mechanism to Prevent Sync Loss

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix

### Problem Solved
**Issue**: After running for days or weeks, the thermostat card would stop receiving updates from Home Assistant, causing the temperature display to become stale and unresponsive.

**Root Cause**: The card was only updating when specific conditions were met, and after extended periods of inactivity, the update mechanism would stop working.

### Solution: Heartbeat Mechanism

#### üîÑ **30-Second Heartbeat**
- Added automatic heartbeat that checks for entity changes every 30 seconds
- Ensures the card stays in sync even during long periods of inactivity
- Only updates when actual changes are detected (performance optimized)

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Update Logic**
- `updateValues()` is now called on every hass update
- Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Entity state tracking prevents unnecessary updates

#### üîß **Enhanced Reliability**
- Automatic reinitialization if entity becomes unavailable
- Proper cleanup when card is removed (prevents memory leaks)
- Better error logging for debugging

#### üìä **Entity State Tracking**
- Tracks entity state changes to detect when updates are needed
- Prevents UI freezing after extended periods
- Maintains sync between local state and entity state

## Technical Details

### New Methods Added
```javascript
_startHeartbeat()           // Starts 30-second heartbeat
_stopHeartbeat()            // Stops heartbeat (cleanup)
_forceUpdateFromEntity()    // Forces update from entity
disconnectedCallback()      // Cleanup when card removed
```

### Improved Methods
```javascript
set hass(hass) {
  // Always update values to ensure UI stays in sync
  this.updateValues();
  
  // Start heartbeat to ensure continuous updates
  this._startHeartbeat();
  
  // ... rest of logic
}

updateValues() {
  // Enhanced with better error handling
  // Fallback mechanisms for missing entities
  // Entity state tracking
}
```

### Heartbeat Logic
```javascript
// Every 30 seconds, check for changes
setInterval(() => {
  if (this._hass && this._config && !this._interacting && !this._dragging) {
    this._forceUpdateFromEntity();
  }
}, 30000);
```

## Impact

### ‚úÖ **User Experience**
- **Always Current**: Temperature display stays accurate for weeks/months
